Overview
========

**VaOceanMobile** is the content project with ocean shader created for **mobile** games on [Unreal Engine 4](https://www.unrealengine.com/). Yes, exactly! It looks the same on mobile and works **really** fast!

Tested both on iOS and Android devices :)

Sure, this ocean shader has limited set of features in comparsion to desktop alternatives, but the key goal was achieved - it's fast, nice-looking for topdown view and works on mobile devices and web.

Current version: **1.0 R 2** (tested for UE 4.9-4.24)
